<p>The Fuller Center for Housing Belo Bamenda â€“ Cameroon, faith-driven and Christ-centered, promotes collaborative and innovative partnerships with goodwill volunteers and partner organizations to provide adequate shelter to people in need.</p>
<p>ABOUT FULLER CENTER FOR HOUSING CAMEROON
Though Cameroon enjoys relatively high political and social stability compared to most other African countries, about a third of its 25 million people live below the international poverty threshold of $1.25 a day (U.S. dollars). The Fuller Center for Housing of Bamenda, Cameroon focuses on repairing and building new homes in the Baingo, Mbingo and Belo communities. Because 52 percent of families living below the poverty level are headed by women, a significant proportion of its work benefits rural women and their children. In rural areas of Cameroon, most houses are built with mud or wattle-and-dub with thatch roofs that require constant maintenance. Often there are no toilet facilities, so villagers are forced to use woods near their houses. These poor living conditions lead to frequent disease, illness and additional economic, emotional and physical strains on families.
