            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>Founded in 2015, our project serves the remote, post-conflict region of Belo-Bamenda where safe housing is scarce. With your help, we’ve already built 25 homes, repaired 7, and housed 175+ people — but the need remains vast.</p>

                “Thanks to the Fuller Center, I no longer sleep on the floor. My children are safe, and we now have hope.”<br>
                <em>– Widow, beneficiary</em>
